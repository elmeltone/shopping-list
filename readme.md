Build A Shopping List App

Thinkful's requirements for this project:

In this lesson, you'll design and code a project from scratch: a shopping list app. The basic requirements for this app are:

Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase.
Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list (you don't necessarily need to use checkboxes for this, but there should be a way of visually distinguishing between purchased and unpurchased items).
Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.
It will be up to you to come up with the look and feel of your app. In the next lesson, you will get a clear idea of what you want to build before you start building. Next, you will build an initial version of your app that demonstrates the layout and style, but does not have the interactive elements. Finally, in the third part of this project, you will use jQuery and JavaScript to write the code that will make your app interactive.
